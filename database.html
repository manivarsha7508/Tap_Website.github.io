       <center><font size="5"><h1>Database Developer Salary in 2023</h1></font></center>
       <font size="5">Most engineering professionals and graduates are frequently unsure of the salary they need
         to demand from potential companies. Here, we’ve attempted to accurately represent the salary you can 
         anticipate based on a variety of circumstances. These are only estimates; your ability to perform the 
         task deftly and intelligently will determine your actual salary.</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">Databases are key parts of contemporary information systems, and database developers are 
            essential to their design, development, and maintenance. Large volumes of data are stored in
             databases, which are used by corporations and other organisations to support their operations
              and make informed choices. Data would be chaotic, inaccessible, and challenging to maintain
               without professional database developers, which would result in major inefficiencies and 
               errors in data processing.</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">They make sure that data is organised, accessible, and secure, all of which are essential 
            for promoting innovation, enhancing productivity, and making well-informed business decisions.
             Without skilled database developers, businesses would find it difficult to handle their data 
             efficiently, which could result in serious inefficiencies and data breaches.</font>
        <center><font size="5"><h2>Who is a database developer?</h2></font></center>
        <font size="5">A software professional who focuses on developing, building, and maintaining databases
             is known as a database developer. They are in charge of designing the database structure, 
             producing queries, constructing data models, and enhancing database efficiency. They play a
              crucial role in ensuring the database is effective, safe, and scalable.</font>
        <center><font><h2>Required skills and qualifications</h2></font></center>
        <font size="5">Depending on the business, industry, and work role, different skills and qualifications
             may be needed for a database developer. </font>
        <font size="5">Nonetheless, a few of the most typical abilities and credentials are as follows:</font>
        <ul>
            <li><font size="5">Strong knowledge of <b>MySQL, Oracle,</b> and <b>SQL Server database management systems.</b></font> </li>
            <li><font size="5">A working knowledge of <b>SQL</b> and other relevant database programming languages.</font> </li>
            <li><font size="5">Understanding of database modelling, design, and optimization. </font></li>
            <li><font size="5">Understanding of security best practices and database administration. </font></li>
            <li><font size="5">Knowledge of data mining and data warehousing principles. </font></li>
            <li><font size="5">Familiarity with programming languages such as <b> Java, Python,</b> and <b>C++.</b></font></li>

        </ul>

        <font size="5">When it comes to the education needed to become a Database developer, an ideal candidate should have 
            a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology, or a related discipline is often 
            required. But in recent years after the pandemic, candidates having skills in databases but not having
             a computer engineering degree are directly competing with ones who have in the race to find a job as a
              database developer. So you do not need to have a degree in computer science to get into the IT industry 
              in today’s era where skills dominate degrees.</font>
        <center><font size="5"><h2>Salary for database developers in 2023</h2></font></center>
        <font size="5">Comparison of salaries in 2020 and 2021</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">The typical salary for a database developer in India in 2020 ranged from INR 500,000 to INR 900,000
             per year, based on experience level and industry, according to several sources, including Payscale and Glassdoor.</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">The average salary for database developers in India has increased slightly in 2021, with some studies 
            estimating a rise of between 5% and 10%. The rise in demand for database management and data analysis 
            capabilities across businesses is credited with this rise.</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">It’s crucial to remember that compensation trends can differ significantly depending on a variety of
             factors, including region, firm size, sector, and amount of expertise. Salary may potentially be affected
              by the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on the labour market.</font><br><br>
        <center><font size="5"><h2>The projected growth rate for the industry</h2></font></center>
        <font size="5">In the upcoming years, it is anticipated that the database industry will expand steadily. 
            Market research estimates from a variety of sources, including ResearchAndMarkets and MarketsandMarkets, 
            predict that the global database management system (DBMS) market will expand between 2021 and 2026 at a
             compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 9%.</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">This growth is mostly caused by the growing volume of data that businesses and organisations 
            produce, which calls for efficient data management, storage, and analysis. The proliferation of Internet
             of things (IoT) devices, the growing demand for real-time data analytics, and the increasing usage of 
             cloud-based database systems are all factors in the expansion of the database sector.</font>
        <center><font size="5"><h2>Conclusion</h2></font></center>
        <font size="5">A thorough knowledge of database structure, data modelling, and database management 
            systems is essential for a database developer. Also, they must be proficient in a variety of 
            programming languages, including Python, Java, and SQL.</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">One needs a strong analytical mindset and the ability to deal with massive datasets
             to spot trends and patterns in order to become a successful database engineer. For them to solve
              database issues and enhance efficiency, they also need to be detail-oriented and possess good
               problem-solving abilities. Since database developers frequently collaborate with other members 
               of a team and must successfully convey technical knowledge to stakeholders who are not 
               technically savvy, strong communication skills are also crucial.</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">Tap Academy’s  AR-based educational technologies can give students 
            an immersive and dynamic learning environment that enables them to visualise and 
            engage with virtual objects and settings in a way that is not possible with conventional
             teaching techniques. </font><br><br>
        <font size="5">With the aid of augmented reality, Tap Academy can offer real-world learning situations
             that can aid students in developing skills in a more interesting and efficient manner. For 
             instance, a database development course may employ augmented reality to imitate database 
             environments and give students a more visible and easy method to interact with them. Learning
              difficult database ideas and acquiring practical abilities that individuals may use in 
              real-world situations can both benefit from this.</font><br><br>
        <font size="5">On the other hand, they also provide placement opportunities for students who enrol 
            to their course and help students get their first IT job. Tap Academy has been achieving this 
            feat for 2 years of its operation started. They have been able to place students from non-IT 
            backgrounds and helped them secure a job in the IT industry. </font>
